            <img src="images\R.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="350" height="200">
            <p>During the pandemic, many animal shelters had to scale back operations or close entirely, reducing the capacity for dog and cat intakes.</p>
            <p>In 2020, the nationwide decline in pet adoptions was estimated at nearly 24%, accompanied by an increase in the foster population of nearly 19%</p>
            <p>The percentage of animals entering foster care increased from 2019, with 11% uptick for dogs and 26% for cats, and a nationwide increase of approximately 19% in the foster pet population</p>

            <p>Animal shelters were the leading source (19%) from where dog owners obtained their pets, followed by breeders (19%), and 18% from a friend or relative.</p>
